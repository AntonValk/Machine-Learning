## Contents:

Statistical Decision Theory - Linear Regression - K-NN - Linear Classification - Indicator Regression - PCA - LDA - QDA - GDA - Naive Bayes - Logistic Regression - Perceptron - Separating Hyperplanes - SVM - Decision Trees - ensemble learning - bagging - boosting - stacking - Neural Networks - Backpropagation - Training Deep Neural Nets - Convnets - RNNs - MLE/MAP - Bayesian Learning - Density estimation - Bayesian Linear Regression - Kernel Methods - Gaussian Process - Clustering - K-means - DBScan - GMM - EM Algorithm - Frontiers in ML. 

## Tools:
At least Python 3.5 and compatible Numpy, OpenCV, tensorflow, keras, sci-kit learn and their dependencies. A good way of getting all of these is Anaconda.

If you are using this repo to learn or to do your assingment please consider giving it a star so more people can see it.
Also please follow academic integrity and do not copy paste my code, you should rather try to understand it and implement your own solutions.
